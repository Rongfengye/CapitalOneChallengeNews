# My Solution
For this MindSumo Challenge, I utilized HTML & CSS to design and format my page, as well as Javascript to make my website interactive and to fetch data from NewsApi. In addition, I used Github pages to deploy my website, the Skeleton library (https://cdnjs.com/libraries/skeleton) to enhance features of my page, and gained inspiration from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx7pSLjLNQA&ab_channel=Divinector to create an animated background.

# Challenge Prompt 
**Copied from MindSumo:** https://www.mindsumo.com/contests/newsapi

We would like you to build a web application using News API that will help users find their desired news. We want to see your creativity in action! Just make sure your solutions include these requirements: 

1. Submit a deployed web application and include both your website URL and the supporting Github repository. 
2. The app must use News API as the exclusive data source.
3. Your app should limit searches to the following three categories: entertainment, sports, and technology. Any news not belonging to one of the approved categories should be filtered accordingly.
4. Your app should display search results in a user-friendly format that provides information about the news article (headline, source, date, etc). Be sure to include a link to the article that opens in a new tab/window.

**Considerations:**
- If a resource is not accessible, the return code should be addressed.
- Images fetched from URLs are various sizes, so care should be given with re-sizing images displayed.

Feel free to go above and beyond these requirements as you build your solution! Here are some other features to consider: 
- Display images and descriptions returned by the API in a clever or visually pleasing way
- **Extra Credit** will be given for detecting which articles are behind paywalls and displaying an indication of a paywall.

**Submissions will be graded on the following criteria:**
- Meets Deliverables
- Creativity
- Clarity
